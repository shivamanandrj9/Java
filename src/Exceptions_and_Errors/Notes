Types of errors:

1) Syntax error
2) Logical Error
3) Runtime Error -> run time ke time code phat gaya

Exception Handling is a way to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
The jvm throws an object during runtime when an error occurs. This object is called an exception object.
