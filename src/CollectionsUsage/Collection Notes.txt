Following are the interfaces which are implemented by the different privateClasses that we use in collection. These all extend the Collection interface.

1) List(Interface) -> ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Vector
2) Set -> EnumSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
3) Queue -> ArrayDeque, LinkedList, PriorityQueue
3) DeQueue -> ArrayDeque, LinkedList (Deque interface actually extends Queue interface and it forces the implementing class to implement extra methods like addFirst()/ addLast(), removeFirst() / removeLast(), peekFirst() / peekLast())

All the privateClasses belonging to an interface have same methods
but they are implemeneted in a different manner in each of
the privateClasses and that's why their complexity is different.

An use case will be like, you define a general method, that
takes a List(Inteface) as an argument, and you can pass any of them and they will work fine.
