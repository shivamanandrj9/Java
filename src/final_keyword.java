/*
We can use final keyword with variables, methods and class.

1) If we make a variable final, it is a constant and cannot be changed by any means. By convention, we use
    capital letters for constants. Also, it becomes constant only after you assign it a value i.e. If we declare
    it first and leave it and then at later place we assign it. It will be constant thereafter.


2) A final class cannot be extended.

3) A final method cannot be overridden.
