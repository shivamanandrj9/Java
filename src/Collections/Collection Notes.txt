Following are the interfaces which are implemented by the different classes that we use in collection. These all extend the Collection interface.

1) List(Interface) -> ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, Vector
2) Set -> EnumSet, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
3) Queue -> ArrayDeque, LinkedList, PriorityQueue

All the classes belonging to an interface have same methods
but they are implemeneted in a different manner in each of
the classes and that's why their complexity is different.

An use case will be like, you define a general method, that
takes a List(Inteface) as an argument, and you can pass any of them and they will work fine.
