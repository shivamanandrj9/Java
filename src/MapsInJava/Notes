Map interface is not a subtype of collection interface. It is a separate interface. It is used to store key-value pairs. It is an object that maps keys to values. A map cannot contain duplicate keys; each key can map to at most one value.

You can implement maps in Java from two interfaces: Map and SortedMap.
The SortedMap interface extends the Map interface.
There are three classes to implement maps. These three classes are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

i.e. HashMap implements Map interface
     LinkedHashMap implements Map interface
     TreeMap implements SortedMap interface
