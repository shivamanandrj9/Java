1. Have private methods that take care of the operations on the linked list.
2. In place of synchronized, we can use (Concurrent Hash Map but still while doing the manipulation of the linked list, we would require a lock for that period of time, so instead of making the whole method as synchronized, we can use reeentrant lock that can be used mid funtion).
